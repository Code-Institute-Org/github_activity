# Github activity

There are 2 functions in this repo, the first one in app.py (count_commits(user, days)) can count all commits for all repos of a given user and a given timeframe in days to check back through

The second function ( calc_project_commits(repo_url, timeframe) ) in app2.py is design to take the repo of a students project and check the amount of commits for a given timeframe in days from today

The tests file (test.py) runs a number of tests on both function using my own repo, which may give different results in time as the commit count changes on my own repos so it maybe best to replace those tests with a known repositry
